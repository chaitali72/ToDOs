MongoDB: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.

Express : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

CRUD: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Which are the basic operations that a simple web app would be designed to achieve.
